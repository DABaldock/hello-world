# hello-world
Learning to create a repository.

I am Daryl Baldock, I am currently studying at University of Central Lancashire.
I have been told that it is excellent to have a web presense, so I have decided to create a GitHub account.
This will help with experience and learning, but also create a web presense suitable for computing students, similar to myself.
